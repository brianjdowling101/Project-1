# Features

•	Navigation Bar:

Featured on all five sections. The fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Trinity College Library (hero image), The Book of Kells, Timeline, The Old College Library, and Redevelopment Project section. The navigation bar will stay fixed and will allow the user to easily navigate from section to section across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

•	The landing page image:

The landing page has a photograph of The Old College Library with a textbox over it and uses an attention-grabbing animation to introduce the user to Trinity College Library.

•	The Book of Kells:

The user will be able to access images & text about The Book of Kells which has been sourced from official Trinity College accounts and supports evidence-based information.

• A Timeline of Events:

The Timeline section follows the journey of The Book of Kells and how it arrived at its permanent home in The Long Room. From here the timeline follows the history of The Long Room. The context is displayed in seven separate boxes with the year at the beginning of each paragraph.

# Testing

• Screen Size:

Trinity College Library (hero image): Works perfectly on all screen sizes. I edited the CSS (Cover-text): right command from a value of 150px to 10%. This allowed the textbox to be properly viewed on the screen with no text missing. Originally before the edit, the textbox was missing on a mobile screen.

The Book of Kells: can be viewed perfectly on all device screens.

Timeline: can be viewed perfectly on all device screens.

The Old College Library: can be viewed perfectly on all device screens.

Redevelopment Project: can be view perfectly on all device screens.

Footer: can be viewed perfectly on all device screens.

All sections can be perfectly view on desktop computer and laptop.



• Browsers:

Works in Chromes, Internet Explorer and Safari.

• Bugs/prombles:

The Old College Library section: when viewing on a moblie device. A line of text is missing from each secton.

No bugs found when testing in launch.json .vscode.
