# Project-1
Trinity College Library:

Trinity College Library is a website that hopes to inform users about historical facts about the old college library, The Book of Kells, and The Long Room. The goal of the website is to provide a reliable source of information about the college library, The Book of Kells, and Room Long.

# Features

•	Navigation Bar:

Featured on all five sections. The fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Trinity College Library (hero image), The Book of Kells, Timeline, The Old College Library, and Redevelopment Project section. The navigation bar will stay fixed and will allow the user to easily navigate from section to section across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

•	The landing page image:

The landing page has a photograph of The Old College Library with a textbox over it and uses an attention-grabbing animation to introduce the user to Trinity College Library.

•	The Book of Kells:

The user will be able to access images & text about The Book of Kells which has been sourced from official Trinity College accounts and supports evidence-based information.

• A Timeline of Events:

The Timeline section follows the journey of The Book of Kells and how it arrived at its permanent home in The Long Room. From here the timeline follows the history of The Long Room. The context is displayed in seven separate boxes with the year at the beginning of each paragraph.

• The Old Library:

The user can access two images and text about The Old Library that have been sourced from official Trinity College accounts and support evidence-based information.

• The Redevelopment Project:

Users may access a video and text about the redevelopment project sourced from official Trinity College accounts and supported by evidence-based information.

• Footer:

The footer helps users to access official Trinity College social media accounts such as Facebook, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

• Background & Text:

The background and text have been chosen to provide a comfortable viewing experience for people with visual impairments.

• Images/Video Supporting The Facts:

The images & video have been sourced from official Trinity College accounts and support evidence-based information. The footer contains links to Trinity College’s official Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter accounts. The video is about the development project and is set to mute, but users have the option to unmute the video and listen to the audio.

• Evidence-based Information:

The information is evidence-based and has been sourced from official Trinity College accounts such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter.

#Testing

• Screen Size:d

All sections can be perfectly view on desktop computer and laptop.

Trinity College Library (hero image): 

Works perfectly on all screen sizes. I edited the CSS (Cover-text): right command from a value of 150px to 10%. This allowed the textbox to be properly viewed on the screen with no text missing. Originally before the edit, the textbox was missing on a mobile screen.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
