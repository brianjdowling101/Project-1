## The Header

- The Trinity College Library website features a well-structured header that provides users with a clear understanding of what the website is about. The header comprises an image of The Old Library at the center, which reinforces the website's focus on historical artifacts. In addition, there is a textbox that displays the message "TRINITY COLLEGE LIBRARY: HOME TO THE BOOK OF KELLS & THE LONG ROOM". This text serves as a direct and clear introduction to the website's primary focus.

- Moreover, the use of The Old Library image in the header not only reinforces the website's purpose but also sets the tone for the entire website's color scheme. The combination of red and dark colors used throughout the website adds a sense of elegance and sophistication, which is in line with the Trinity College Library's rich history and heritage.

- Overall, the header's design provides a visually appealing and informative introduction to the website, allowing users to navigate the website with ease and confidence.

## Navigation bar

- The website's navigation bar is located above the header (Image and Textbox of The Old Library) and features links to the following sections: The Trinity College Library (Home), Book of Kells, Time-line, The Old Library, and Redevelopment. These links direct users to their respective sections on the same page. Additionally, there is a contact form located before the website's footer.

- The font used for the navigation bar is consistent with the rest of the website, but the background colour of the navigation bar is different (Red in colour), making it stand out. When a user hovers over a link, the background colour changes to red, making it clear which link has been selected. This design feature makes the navigation bar both easy to use and accessible.

- Overall, the navigation bar is simple, effective, and easy to spot, ensuring users can easily navigate through the website and find the information they need.
