            <p>The Library began with the founding of Trinity College in 1592. The building was design by Thomas Burgh
                1712 and took 20 years to complete.
                In 1661, Henry Jones presented it with the Book of Kells, its most famous manuscript.
                James Ussher (1625â€“56), Archbishop of Armagh, whose most important works were "Veterum Epistolarum
                Hibernicarum Sylloge" (1632)
                and "Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates" (1639), left his valuable library, comprising several
                thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the Library.</p>

        <div class="library">
            <p>His complete works were published by the Library in twenty-four volumes.
                In 1801, the Library was given legal deposit rights, making it the only library in Ireland to have such
                rights for the United Kingdom at that time. the site selected by the creators more than three centuries
                ago to protect the printed materials from the elements.

                Over 200,000 of the library's oldest books are housed in the 65-meter-long room, which is the longest
                single-room library in all of Europe.

                At each end of the gallery are reading rooms, making it a functioning library. Given the rarity of the
                space, use and pervation are handled with extra caution. The librry plays a central role in supporting
                the research and teaching of the entire college.</p>

        <h2>Redevelopment of Project</h2>
        <img src="image/redevelopment.webp" alt="The Long Room">
        <p>The Old Library is one of Ireland's most famous landmarks and one of the greatest libraries in the entire
            world.
            In its distinctive twin function as a top-notch library and a national cultural institution, it unites
            legacy and scholarship.
            For more than 400 years, the Library of Trinity College Dublin has been responsible for caring for its
            priceless treasures, which span millennia.
            However, it currently confronts serious environmental and conservation challenges.
            To protect the Old Library structure and preserve its priceless treasures for future generations, the Old
            Library Redevelopment Project will make use of the best design and technology of the twenty-first century.
            It entails immediate structural and environmental improvements as well as the renovation of the facilities
            to match the top libraries and museums throughout the globe.
            A top-notch design team is being led by the award-winning architects Heneghan Peng in this game-changing
            construction.</p>
