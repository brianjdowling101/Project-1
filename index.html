                <p class="context">The Book of Kells is a gospel book, containing the four accounts of Christ’s life
                    that
                    form the New
                    Testament of the Bible.

                    One of the few priceless examples of a significant book-making tradition that flourished in the
                    Irish
                    Church in the eighth and ninth centuries, it is a rare and priceless relic. The manuscript's name
                    comes
                    from the monastery in Ireland's County Meath, Kells. Around 806 AD, monks escaping Viking attacks at
                    the
                    monastery of Iona, off the western coast of Scotland, founded the monastery.</p>

                <p class="context">Although it is impossible to date the manuscript with absolute certainty, it is
                    generally
                    agreed that it
                    was probably started on Iona in the late eighth century, and may have been transferred to Ireland
                    for
                    safety prior to its completion. It remained at Kells until the late seventeenth century, when it was
                    brought to Trinity College in Dublin for safekeeping.</p>

                    <p> 800AD: The Book of Kells was written on The Island of Iona, off the coast of Scotland.
                        Researchers
                        believe that it was originally produced in a monastery by three artists and four scribes.
                        When
                        Iona was attacked by Vikings, the surviving monks moved to a sister monastery in Kells, Co.
                        Meath. Some scholars believe that it was here that the Book of Kells was finished.</p>
