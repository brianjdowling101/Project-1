            <p>The Book of Kells is a gospel book, containing the four accounts of Christ’s life that form the New
                Testament of the Bible.

                One of the few priceless examples of a significant book-making tradition that flourished in the Irish
                Church in the eighth and ninth centuries, it is a rare and priceless relic. The manuscript's name comes
                from the monastery in Ireland's County Meath, Kells. Around 806 AD, monks escaping Viking attacks at the
                monastery of Iona, off the western coast of Scotland, founded the monastery.</p>

            <p>Although it is impossible to date the manuscript with absolute certainty, it is generally agreed that it
                was probably started on Iona in the late eighth century, and may have been transferred to Ireland for
                safety prior to its completion. It remained at Kells until the late seventeenth century, when it was
                brought to Trinity College in Dublin for safekeeping.</p>

            <p>The Library began with the founding of Trinity College in 1592. The building was design by Thomas Burgh
                1712 and took 20 years to complete.
                In 1661, Henry Jones presented it with the Book of Kells, its most famous manuscript.
                James Ussher (1625–56), Archbishop of Armagh, whose most important works were "Veterum Epistolarum
                Hibernicarum Sylloge" (1632)
                and "Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates" (1639), left his valuable library, comprising several
                thousand printed books and manuscripts, to the Library.</p>

        <div class="library">
            <p>His complete works were published by the Library in twenty-four volumes.
                In 1801, the Library was given legal deposit rights, making it the only library in Ireland to have such
                rights for the United Kingdom at that time. the site selected by the creators more than three centuries
                ago to protect the printed materials from the elements.

                Over 200,000 of the library's oldest books are housed in the 65-meter-long room, which is the longest
                single-room library in all of Europe.

                At each end of the gallery are reading rooms, making it a functioning library. Given the rarity of the
                space, use and pervation are handled with extra caution. The librry plays a central role in supporting
                the research and teaching of the entire college.</p>
