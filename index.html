                        800AD: The Book of Kells was written on The Island of Iona, off the coast of Scotland.
                        Researchers believe that it was originally produced in a monastery by three artists and four
                        scribes.
                        When Iona was attacked by Vikings, the surviving monks moved to a sister monastery in Kells, Co.
                        Meath.
                        Some scholars believe that it was here that the Book of Kells was finished.

                    1712 and took 20 years to complete.
                    In 1661, Henry Jones presented it with the Book of Kells, its most famous manuscript.
                    James Ussher (1625â€“56), Archbishop of Armagh, whose most important works were "Veterum Epistolarum
                    Hibernicarum Sylloge" (1632)
                    and "Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates" (1639), left his valuable library, comprising several

                    At each end of the gallery are reading rooms, making it a functioning library. Given the rarity of
